## Overview

AI Context Engineering focuses on optimizing information structure, formatting, and sequencing specifically for AI comprehension and processing. This domain establishes principles for creating context that maximizes AI understanding while minimizing cognitive load, enabling more accurate interpretation and more effective task execution through strategic information architecture.

## AI Context Engineering Principles

### Information Sequencing Principles

Strategic ordering of information to match AI processing patterns and comprehension optimization:

#### Dependency-First Ordering
- **Definition**: Present prerequisite knowledge and dependencies before dependent concepts to establish proper conceptual foundation
- **Implementation**: 
  - Place foundational concepts at the beginning of context assembly
  - Ensure all prerequisites are loaded before concepts that depend on them
  - Use dependency chains to automatically order information
- **AI Processing Benefits**: Reduces forward references that can confuse AI reasoning chains
- **Example Pattern**: Database Schema → API Endpoints → Frontend Integration

#### General-to-Specific Progression  
- **Definition**: Start with broad context and architectural overview before diving into specific implementation details
- **Implementation**:
  - Begin with domain overviews and high-level patterns
  - Progress through intermediate abstractions
  - End with specific implementation details and code examples
- **AI Processing Benefits**: Provides conceptual scaffolding that supports detailed understanding
- **Example Pattern**: System Architecture → Component Design → Implementation Methods → Code Examples

#### Problem-Solution Pairing
- **Definition**: Present challenges immediately followed by resolution approaches to minimize cognitive gap between problem and solution
- **Implementation**:
  - Identify problems and constraints before presenting solutions
  - Pair each challenge with its specific resolution approach
  - Provide reasoning chains connecting problems to solutions
- **AI Processing Benefits**: Enables clear causal reasoning and solution validation
- **Example Pattern**: "Authentication Challenge: User sessions need security → Solution: JWT tokens with expiration"

#### Conceptual Building Blocks
- **Definition**: Layer information so each element builds systematically upon previous understanding without gaps or logical leaps
- **Implementation**:
  - Establish atomic concepts before combining them
  - Ensure each new concept references only previously established knowledge
  - Create clear bridges between related concepts
- **AI Processing Benefits**: Supports incremental understanding and reduces inference overhead
- **Example Pattern**: User Entity → User Authentication → User Sessions → User Permissions

### Cognitive Load Management Strategies

Structuring information to prevent AI processing bottlenecks while maximizing comprehension:
