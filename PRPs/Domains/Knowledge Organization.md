## Overview

Knowledge Organization encompasses the modern principles and methodologies for structuring, categorizing, and organizing information in ways that maximize understanding, accessibility, and utility for both human and AI consumers. This domain establishes the foundational practices for creating coherent knowledge hierarchies, effective categorization systems, and scalable organizational patterns that enable efficient knowledge discovery and context assembly.

## Organizational Principles

### Hierarchical Structuring

Knowledge organization follows clear hierarchical patterns that establish parent-child relationships between concepts:

- **Domain Hierarchies**: High-level knowledge areas that contain specialized sub-domains
- **Conceptual Inheritance**: Child concepts inherit context and patterns from parent domains
- **Scope Boundaries**: Clear delineation of what knowledge belongs in each organizational unit
- **Cross-Domain References**: Strategic connections between related but separate knowledge areas

### Atomic Knowledge Units

Each piece of knowledge should be organized into atomic, focused units that serve single purposes:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each file addresses one specific knowledge area or concept
- **Self-Contained Context**: Units provide sufficient context to be understood independently
- **Composable Elements**: Atomic units can be combined to create comprehensive understanding
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling while maintaining necessary relationships

## Categorization Strategies

### Domain Decomposition Strategies

Complex knowledge areas require systematic decomposition approaches to break them into manageable, focused components while maintaining coherent relationships and enabling effective context assembly. Four strategic approaches provide comprehensive coverage for different organizational needs:

#### Functional Decomposition

Organize domains based on capabilities, features, and operational boundaries:

**Core Principles:**
- **Capability Boundaries**: Group knowledge by what systems or processes can accomplish
- **Feature Clustering**: Organize related functional areas that work together to deliver user value
- **Operational Separation**: Distinguish between different types of operations and their knowledge requirements
- **Service-Oriented Grouping**: Structure knowledge around discrete services or functional units

**Application Guidelines:**
- Identify primary capabilities and create domain boundaries around each distinct capability
- Group supporting knowledge and context within each capability domain
- Establish clear interfaces between functional domains while maintaining independence
- Use functional hierarchy to manage complexity (high-level capabilities → specific features → implementation details)

**Decision Criteria:** Use functional decomposition when knowledge areas have distinct operational purposes, when capabilities can be developed independently, or when teams are organized around functional responsibilities.

#### Technical Decomposition

Structure domains by implementation layers, technologies, and system components:

**Core Principles:**
- **Layer-Based Organization**: Separate knowledge by architectural layers (presentation, business logic, data)
- **Technology Clustering**: Group knowledge around specific technologies, frameworks, or platforms
- **Component Boundaries**: Organize around system components that have distinct technical characteristics
- **Integration Patterns**: Structure knowledge around how different technical elements interact

**Application Guidelines:**
- Map technical architecture and create domains for each major layer or component
- Group technology-specific knowledge (configurations, patterns, troubleshooting) within appropriate domains
- Establish clear dependency chains between technical layers in domain hierarchies
- Use technical complexity to guide domain granularity (complex technologies → more specialized domains)

**Decision Criteria:** Use technical decomposition when knowledge areas align with system architecture, when technical expertise is specialized, or when implementation approaches vary significantly by technology.

#### User-Centric Decomposition

Structure domains around user goals, workflows, and interaction patterns:

**Core Principles:**
- **User Journey Alignment**: Organize knowledge to follow user paths through systems and processes
- **Goal-Oriented Grouping**: Structure around what users are trying to accomplish
- **Workflow Coherence**: Group knowledge that supports complete user workflows
- **Interaction Context**: Organize around different user interaction modes and contexts

**Application Guidelines:**
- Map user journeys and create domains that support complete user goals
- Group all knowledge needed for users to accomplish specific objectives
- Structure domains to minimize user context switching between different knowledge areas
- Use user complexity and expertise levels to guide domain organization depth

**Decision Criteria:** Use user-centric decomposition when knowledge areas serve distinct user populations, when user workflows are the primary organizing principle, or when user experience optimization is the primary goal.

#### Process Decomposition

Organize domains by business processes, operational workflows, and procedural sequences:

**Core Principles:**
- **Process Boundaries**: Structure around complete business processes or operational procedures
- **Workflow Sequence**: Organize knowledge to follow process execution order
- **Responsibility Alignment**: Group knowledge around process ownership and accountability
- **Lifecycle Management**: Structure around different phases of processes or operational lifecycles

**Application Guidelines:**
- Map business processes and create domains for each distinct process or major process phase
- Sequence domains to follow process execution order where dependencies exist
- Group process-specific knowledge (procedures, decisions, validations) within process domains
- Use process complexity and organizational boundaries to determine domain scope

**Decision Criteria:** Use process decomposition when knowledge areas align with business processes, when organizational structure follows process ownership, or when process optimization is the primary concern.

### Decomposition Decision Framework

**Selection Criteria:**

Choose decomposition strategy based on primary organizational drivers:
- **Functional**: When capabilities are distinct and teams align with functional areas
- **Technical**: When system architecture drives knowledge organization and technical expertise is specialized
- **User-Centric**: When user experience is primary concern and user workflows are well-defined
- **Process**: When business processes are clear and organizational structure follows process ownership

**Hybrid Approaches:**

Complex domains often benefit from combining strategies:
- **Functional + Technical**: Use functional decomposition at high level, technical decomposition within complex functional areas
- **User-Centric + Process**: Organize around user journeys while maintaining process workflow coherence
- **Technical + Process**: Structure technical domains around operational processes they support

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Primary Driver Assessment**: What is the main organizing principle? (capabilities, architecture, users, processes)
2. **Complexity Evaluation**: How complex is each potential domain? (high complexity → deeper decomposition)
3. **Team Alignment**: How are teams organized? (choose strategy that aligns with team responsibilities)
4. **Evolution Requirements**: How will domains evolve? (choose strategy that supports expected changes)
