## Template Configuration Guide

### Frontmatter Configuration

#### Core Identification Metadata

Essential metadata elements that enable AI processing and content classification:

```yaml
---
# Core Identification Metadata (Required)
type: domain                                    # Always 'domain' for domain templates
tags: [primary-domain, technology-area, complexity-level, implementation-phase]
created: YYYY-MM-DD                            # ISO date format
updated: YYYY-MM-DD                            # Update when content changes
status: active|pending|completed|archived     # Current lifecycle stage
```

**Configuration Guidelines**:
- **Tags**: Use 3-5 tags maximum, include primary domain area, relevant technologies, complexity level (beginner/intermediate/expert), and implementation phase
- **Status**: Set to 'active' for current domains, 'pending' for planned domains, 'completed' for finished implementations, 'archived' for deprecated content
- **Dates**: Maintain accurate created/updated dates to support temporal relevance in AI context assembly

#### Semantic Relationship Metadata

Advanced relationship configurations that enable intelligent context assembly:

```yaml
# Semantic Relationship Metadata (Enhanced)
up: "[[Parent Domain.md]]"                     # Hierarchical inheritance (critical dependency, weight: 0.9)
related: "[[Related Domain A.md]], [[Related Domain B.md]]"  # Lateral relationships (supporting context, weight: 0.7)
dependencies: "[[Required Context.md]]"        # Prerequisites (critical dependency, weight: 1.0)
complements: "[[Synergistic Domain.md]]"       # Complementary relationships (supporting context, weight: 0.7)
alternatives: "[[Alternative Approach.md]]"    # Alternative approaches (optional reference, weight: 0.4)
```

**Relationship Selection Guidelines**:

**Use `up` for**:
- Parent domains that this domain inherits concepts from
- Broader knowledge areas that provide context and foundation
- Single parent relationship preferred (avoid multiple inheritance)

**Use `related` for**:
- Peer-level domains with similar scope or purpose
- Domains that frequently co-occur in implementation contexts
- Cross-cutting concerns that intersect with this domain

**Use `dependencies` for**:
- Prerequisites that must be understood before this domain
- Foundational knowledge required for domain comprehension
- Critical external context needed for successful implementation

**Use `complements` for**:
- Domains that enhance this domain's capabilities when combined
- Synergistic relationships where combined use provides added value
- Integration partnerships that create emergent functionality

**Use `alternatives` for**:
- Different approaches to solving the same fundamental problems
- Competing methodologies or architectural choices
- Trade-off scenarios requiring approach comparison

#### Contextual Hints for AI Assembly

Metadata that guides AI processing and context optimization:

```yaml
# Contextual Hints for AI Assembly
complexity: expert|intermediate|beginner       # Audience and cognitive load indicators
domain_scope: broad|focused|specialized        # Information density and coverage level
implementation_readiness: theoretical|practical|production  # Maturity and actionability level
relationship_density: high|medium|low          # Network connectivity for context assembly
context_weight: critical|supporting|optional   # Assembly priority for AI processing
```

**Configuration Strategies**:

**Complexity Level Selection**:
- **Beginner**: Foundational concepts, extensive examples, step-by-step guidance
- **Intermediate**: Balanced theory and practice, moderate detail level

#### Adaptive Template Configuration

Settings that enable template customization based on usage context:

```yaml
# Adaptive Template Configuration

```

**Adaptive Configuration Guidelines**:

**Template Variant Selection**:

## AI Optimization Strategies

### Information Sequencing

Implementation of dependency-first ordering for optimal AI processing:

**Prerequisite Chain Construction**:
```markdown
**Prerequisites**: Must understand **[[Foundation Concept.md]]** before proceeding
↓
**Core Implementation**: Building on prerequisite knowledge, implement **[[Primary Patterns.md]]**
↓  
**Integration Layer**: Connect to **[[Related Systems.md]]** using established patterns
↓
**Advanced Applications**: Optimize and extend using **[[Expert Techniques.md]]**
```

**Progressive Disclosure Implementation**:
- **Foundation Layer** (20% cognitive load): Core concepts and basic relationships
- **Implementation Layer** (50% cognitive load): Specific procedures and technical details
- **Integration Layer** (30% cognitive load): Advanced patterns and edge cases

### Cognitive Load Management

Structured approaches to preventing AI processing bottlenecks:

**Chunk Size Optimization**:
- Limit sections to 200-300 words for complex technical content
- Use subsections to break down complex topics into digestible units
- Provide clear section boundaries and topic transitions

**Context Window Efficiency**:
- Remove redundant explanations and duplicate information
- Prioritize critical information for current task goals
- Use structured formats that convey maximum information per token

**Attention Focus Mechanisms**:
- Use **bold** for key concepts and critical information
- Use `code formatting` for technical specifics and exact references
- Use > blockquotes for warnings, constraints, and important principles
- Use numbered lists for sequential processes and procedures

### Semantic Relationship Integration

Practical approaches for implementing semantic relationships:

**Explicit Relationship Documentation**:
```markdown
**Relationship Type**: **[[Target Domain.md]]** - {Clear description of relationship nature}
- **Semantic Meaning**: {Why this relationship exists and what it signifies}
- **Context Weight**: {Critical (1.0) | Supporting (0.7) | Optional (0.4)}
- **Integration Points**: {How domains connect and interact}
```

**Bidirectional Consistency Maintenance**:
- Ensure reciprocal relationships are documented in linked domains
- Verify relationship types are semantically consistent in both directions
- Maintain relationship strength consistency across domain pairs
