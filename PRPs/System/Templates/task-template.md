## Validation

### Progressive Validation Strategy

[Define validation approach for each implementation stage:]

#### Pre-Implementation Validation
- [ ] All critical dependencies resolved (weight â‰¥ 0.8)
- [ ] Design patterns identified and understood
- [ ] Required permissions and access verified
- [ ] Validation checkpoint: `pre-implementation`

#### Implementation Validation
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration points tested
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Validation checkpoint: `implementation`

#### Completion Validation
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Dependent tasks unblocked
- [ ] Validation checkpoint: `completion`

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Pre-implementation checks
echo "Checking dependencies..."
[dependency verification commands]

# Implementation testing
echo "Running unit tests..."
[unit test commands]

echo "Running integration tests..."
[integration test commands]

# Completion validation
echo "Verifying acceptance criteria..."
[acceptance test commands]

# Quality gate checks
echo "Checking quality metrics..."
[quality metric commands]
```
