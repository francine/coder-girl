## Framework Description

Comprehensive composition framework that enables systematic combination of base templates, section patterns, validation patterns, and specialized components to create customized documentation solutions. This framework provides rules, patterns, and tools for consistent template assembly.

## Composition Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```yaml
composition_layers:
  foundation:
    - base_templates: "Structural foundation (base-documentation, base-implementation)"
    - core_metadata: "Essential frontmatter and organizational elements"
    
  structure:
    - section_patterns: "Reusable content sections (overview, implementation, validation)"
    - layout_patterns: "Content organization and flow patterns"
    
  specialization:
    - domain_adaptations: "Content type specific modifications"
    - audience_adaptations: "User-focused customizations"
    
  enhancement:
    - validation_patterns: "Quality assurance and verification frameworks"
    - relationship_patterns: "Semantic linking and dependency management"
    
  customization:
    - organization_patterns: "Company/team specific adaptations"
    - project_patterns: "Context-specific modifications"
```

### Composition Rules

#### Rule 1: Foundation First
```yaml
foundation_rule:
  description: "All compositions must start with a base template"
  implementation:
    - select_base_template: "Choose appropriate foundation"
    - inherit_structure: "Adopt base template organization"

  validation:
    - base_template_present: true
    - required_metadata_complete: true
    - structural_integrity_maintained: true
```

#### Rule 2: Compatible Combinations
```yaml

  validation:
    - no_conflicting_requirements: true
    - interface_compatibility_verified: true
    - semantic_coherence_maintained: true
```

#### Rule 3: Progressive Enhancement
```yaml
enhancement_rule:
  description: "Build complexity incrementally"
  implementation:
    - start_simple: "Begin with minimal viable composition"
    - add_incrementally: "Enhance with additional patterns"
    - validate_continuously: "Verify each addition"
  
  validation:
    - incremental_validation_passed: true
    - complexity_remains_manageable: true
