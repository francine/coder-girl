## Quality Assurance Patterns

### Validation Frameworks

**Consistency Checking**: {Automated and manual approaches for ensuring domain coherence}
- **Semantic Relationship Validation**: Verify that `inherits`, `complements`, and `similar-to` relationships maintain logical consistency
- **Pattern Recognition Validation**: Confirm that structural patterns remain consistent across similar content
- **Integration Validation**: Check that connections to related domains preserve semantic meaning

**Success Criteria Indicators**:
- [ ] **Domain Boundaries**: Clear distinction between what belongs in this domain vs related domains
- [ ] **Concept Coherence**: All concepts within domain support the core purpose statement
- [ ] **Relationship Integrity**: All semantic relationships are bidirectional and logically consistent
- [ ] **Pattern Consistency**: Structural and content patterns align with domain classification

### Template Evolution Mechanisms

**Continuous Improvement Framework**:
- **Usage Analytics**: Track how domain content supports task completion and context assembly
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identify recurring modifications that should be incorporated into base template
- **Community Feedback**: Systematic collection of improvement suggestions and pain points
- **Version Management**: Maintain template evolution while preserving backward compatibility
