## Task Status Management

### Status Values

- **🔵 `todo`** - Not yet started, ready for implementation
- **🟡 `in-progress`** - Currently being worked on
- **🟣 `review`** - Awaiting review or approval
- **🟢 `done`** - Completed successfully
- **🔴 `blocked`** - Cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Status Update Rules

- **Status changes**: Update `status` field in frontmatter only
- **Filename stability**: Do not modify filename when status changes
- **Link preservation**: Status changes must not break existing links
- **Timestamp updates**: Update `updated` field when status changes

### Status Workflow

```text
      ┌───────────────┐
      │     todo      │
      └───────┬───────┘
              │
┌─────────────▼────────────┐
│        in-progress       │
└─────┬───────────────┬────┘
      │               │
┌─────▼─────┐  ┌──────▼─────┐
│  review   │  │  blocked   │◄──┐
└───────┬───┘  └────┬───────┘   │
        │           │           │
      ┌─▼───────────▼─┐         │
      │     done      │         │
      └───────┬───────┘         │
              │                 │
              └─────────────────┘
```

## Severity Classification

### Severity Levels

- **🔴 `critical`** - Emergency response required, system breaking issues
- **🟠 `major`** - Important but not emergency, significant impact

- **🟢 `minor`** - Low priority, cosmetic or optimization tasks

### Severity Usage

- **Visual indication**: Emoji in filename for immediate identification
- **Frontmatter storage**: Severity stored in frontmatter for querying
- **Synchronization**: Keep filename emoji and frontmatter severity aligned
- **Priority queuing**: Use severity for work prioritization

### Severity Update Process

1. Update frontmatter `severity` field
2. Update filename emoji to match
3. Update `updated` timestamp
4. Verify links remain intact
