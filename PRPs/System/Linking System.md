## Linking Strategies

### Hierarchical Navigation

Use `up` field to define parent-child relationships:

```yaml
up: "[[Authentication Backend.md]]"  # Points to parent context
```

**Purpose**: Establishes clear knowledge hierarchy and inheritance patterns

### Cross-References  

Use `related` field for lateral connections:

```yaml
related: "[[JWT Implementation.md]]"  # Points to related content
```

**Purpose**: Creates knowledge networks without hierarchical dependency

### Dependencies

Use `dependencies` field for required prerequisites:

```yaml
dependencies: "[[Database Schema.md]]"  # Must exist before this
```

**Purpose**: Defines implementation order and required knowledge

### Feature Relationships

Use `feature` field to link tasks to parent features:

```yaml
feature: "[[Auth System Feature.md]]"  # Parent feature context
```

**Purpose**: Groups related tasks under feature umbrellas

## Context Assembly Through Links

### Enhanced Link Resolution Algorithm

Integration of knowledge graph navigation strategies with traditional context assembly for intelligent, adaptive context building:

#### Strategic Navigation-Aware Assembly

**Phase 1: Navigation Strategy Selection**
```yaml
assembly_strategy_selection:
  context_analysis:
    - assess_task_complexity
    - determine_user_expertise_level  
    - evaluate_time_constraints
    - identify_implementation_goals
  
  strategy_mapping:
    comprehensive_discovery: "breadth_first_exploration"
    deep_expertise_building: "depth_first_investigation"
    balanced_implementation: "hybrid_traversal"
    quick_context_assembly: "weighted_priority_traversal"
```

**Phase 2: Weighted Context Assembly**
```yaml
weighted_context_assembly:
  initialization:
    - parse_target_file_frontmatter
    - extract_all_relationship_types
    - calculate_relationship_weights
    - apply_contextual_weight_adjustments
    - set_cognitive_load_budget
  
  priority_based_resolution:
    1. critical_dependencies: weight >= 0.8, depth <= 4
    2. supporting_context: weight 0.6-0.79, depth <= 2  
    3. contextual_relevance: dynamic weight, depth <= 3
    4. optional_references: weight < 0.6, depth = 1
    5. feature_context: complete inclusion
    6. target_file: final integration
```

**Phase 3: Navigation Pattern Application**
- **Breadth-First**: When comprehensive understanding needed before specialization
- **Depth-First**: When following critical dependency chains or implementation sequences
- **Hybrid**: When balancing breadth and depth based on relationship weights
- **Weighted Priority**: When cognitive load management is primary concern

#### Traditional Link Resolution Algorithm (Legacy)

Maintained for backward compatibility and simple context assembly scenarios:

1. **Parse target file** frontmatter
2. **Extract all link types** (up, related, dependencies, feature)
3. **Resolve dependencies** to maximum depth 3
4. **Follow up chain** completely to root
5. **Include related content** at depth 1
6. **Load feature content** completely
7. **Deduplicate** files appearing multiple times
8. **Order by dependency** hierarchy

### Navigation Strategy Integration Examples

#### Strategy-Driven Context Assembly

**Breadth-First Exploration Example:**
```text
Target: ðŸŸ¡ Task 08 - Document Knowledge Graph Navigation Strategies.md

Navigation Strategy: Breadth-First (comprehensive understanding)
Weight Threshold: 0.6+ (supporting context and above)

Assembly Order:
Level 1 (Immediate Relationships):
â”œâ”€â”€ up: [[Semantic Relationships.md]] (weight: 0.9)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature: [[Semantic Linking Enhancement.md]] (weight: 1.0)
â””â”€â”€ related: [[ðŸŸ¡ Task 07 - Create Relationship Weighting Guidelines.md]] (weight: 0.8)

Level 2 (Secondary Relationships):
â”œâ”€â”€ [[Knowledge Organization.md]] (via up chain, weight: 0.8)
â”œâ”€â”€ [[AI Context Engineering.md]] (via dependencies, weight: 0.7)
â””â”€â”€ [[Linking System.md]] (via related, weight: 0.6)

Level 3 (Tertiary Context):
â””â”€â”€ Additional supporting relationships as budget permits
```

**Depth-First Investigation Example:**
```text
Target: ðŸ”´ Task 01 - Implement JWT Middleware.md

Navigation Strategy: Depth-First (critical dependency chain)
Weight Threshold: 0.8+ (critical dependencies)

Assembly Order:
1. Strongest dependency chain:
   ðŸ”´ Task 01 â†’ [[Authentication Backend.md]] (1.0) 
   â†’ [[Security Patterns.md]] (0.9) 
   â†’ [[Cryptographic Standards.md]] (0.8)

2. Secondary critical chain:
   [[Authentication Backend.md]] â†’ [[Database Schema.md]] (0.95)
   â†’ [[User Entity Definition.md]] (0.9)

3. Feature context:
   [[Auth System Feature.md]] (complete inclusion)

4. Target integration with full dependency context
```

**Hybrid Traversal Example:**
```text
Target: ðŸŸ  Task 15 - Optimize API Performance.md

Navigation Strategy: Hybrid (balanced approach)
Weight-Based Strategy Selection:

Critical Dependencies (Depth-First, weight â‰¥ 0.8):
â”œâ”€â”€ [[Database Optimization.md]] (0.95) â†’ depth 3
â”œâ”€â”€ [[Caching Strategies.md]] (0.9) â†’ depth 2
â””â”€â”€ [[Load Balancing.md]] (0.85) â†’ depth 2

Supporting Context (Breadth-First, weight 0.6-0.79):
â”œâ”€â”€ [[Monitoring Patterns.md]] (0.7) â†’ depth 1
â”œâ”€â”€ [[Testing Strategies.md]] (0.65) â†’ depth 1
â””â”€â”€ [[Deployment Patterns.md]] (0.6) â†’ depth 1

Optional References (Limited, weight < 0.6):
â””â”€â”€ [[Alternative Frameworks.md]] (0.4) â†’ excluded due to budget
```

### Link Chain Examples

#### Simple Chain (Traditional)

```text
ðŸŸ¡ Task 05 - Add User Validation.md
â”œâ”€â”€ up: [[Authentication Backend.md]]
â”œâ”€â”€ feature: [[User Registration Feature.md]]
â””â”€â”€ related: [[ðŸŸ¢ Task 03 - Setup Database.md]]
```

**Resolution Order**:

1. `[[User Registration Feature.md]]` (feature)
2. `[[Authentication Backend.md]]` (up chain)
3. `[[ðŸŸ¢ Task 03 - Setup Database.md]]` (related)
4. Target task

#### Complex Chain

```text
ðŸ”´ Task 01 - Implement JWT Middleware.md
â”œâ”€â”€ feature: [[Auth System Feature.md]]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ up: [[Authentication Backend.md]]
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ up: [[Backend Architecture.md]]
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ related: [[Security Patterns.md]]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dependencies: [[Database Schema.md]]
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ up: [[Database Architecture.md]]
â””â”€â”€ up: [[Authentication Backend.md]] (deduplicated)
```

**Resolution Order**:

1. `[[Database Schema.md]]` (deepest dependency)
2. `[[Database Architecture.md]]` (dependency up chain)
3. `[[Authentication Backend.md]]` (implementation patterns)
4. `[[Backend Architecture.md]]` (architecture up chain)
5. `[[Security Patterns.md]]` (related patterns)
6. `[[Auth System Feature.md]]` (feature context)
7. Target task

## Error Handling

### Missing Links

**Problem**: Referenced file doesn't exist

```yaml
up: "[[Missing Domain.md]]"  # ERROR: File not found
```

**Actions**:

- Skip link with warning in context
- Create placeholder file if critical
- Continue assembly with available links

### Circular Dependencies

**Problem**: File A links to File B, File B links to File A

```yaml
# File A.md
dependencies: "[[File B.md]]"

# File B.md  
dependencies: "[[File A.md]]"
```

**Actions**:

- Detect cycle during traversal
- Break cycle at detection point
- Include both files once in context
- Log warning about circular dependency

### Depth Limit Exceeded

**Problem**: Link chain exceeds maximum depth

```text
dependencies: A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D â†’ E (exceeds depth 3)
```

**Actions**:

- Truncate chain at depth limit
- Include warning in assembled context
- Load files within limit only

### Invalid Link Format

**Problem**: Malformed wiki-style links

```yaml
up: "Invalid Link Format"  # Missing [[ ]]
related: [[Missing .md extension]]
```

**Actions**:

- Skip malformed links
- Log formatting error
- Continue with valid links

## Hierarchical Relationship Patterns

### Hierarchical Link Types

Enhanced link types that support sophisticated hierarchical structuring patterns:

#### Inheritance Relationships
- **`inherits`**: Child concepts inherit properties from parent domains
- **`specializes`**: Child represents specific implementation of parent concept  
- **`overrides`**: Child provides specialized behavior that replaces inherited patterns
- **`extends`**: Child adds capabilities while preserving parent functionality

#### Composition Relationships  
- **`composed-of`**: Parent contains child as integral component
- **`aggregates`**: Parent coordinates multiple independent children
- **`layers-on`**: Child builds on parent as foundational layer
- **`modules-into`**: Child can be recombined in different parent contexts

#### Cross-Hierarchical Relationships
- **`bridges-to`**: Creates connection between separate hierarchical trees
- **`cross-references`**: Lateral connection preserving primary hierarchy
- **`contextually-relates`**: Dynamic relationship activated by specific contexts
- **`mesh-integrates`**: Intersection point between hierarchical and network patterns

### Hierarchical Traversal Patterns

#### Inheritance Chain Traversal
Systematic navigation of conceptual inheritance relationships:

```yaml
# Inheritance traversal depth limits
inheritance_traversal:
  conceptual_inheritance: 5 levels  # Follow conceptual chains deeply
  behavioral_inheritance: 3 levels  # Implementation patterns moderate depth
  contextual_inheritance: 2 levels  # Environmental factors shallow depth
  selective_inheritance: 1 level    # Explicit overrides immediate only
```

#### Composition Hierarchy Navigation
Optimized paths through compositional structures:

- **Aggregative Composition**: Traverse all integral components at current level before descending
- **Associative Composition**: Follow independent component chains in dependency order  
- **Layered Composition**: Traverse layers in architectural order (foundation to application)
- **Modular Composition**: Dynamic traversal based on current assembly context

#### Cross-Hierarchical Path Finding
Navigation patterns that maintain hierarchical integrity while enabling lateral connections:

- **Bridge Traversal**: Follow bridge concepts to connect separate hierarchical trees
- **Network Overlay**: Navigate lateral connections without breaking primary hierarchical paths
- **Contextual Activation**: Dynamically include cross-hierarchical relationships based on implementation goals
- **Mesh Integration**: Balance hierarchical and network navigation at integration points

### Hierarchical Validation Rules

#### Relationship Consistency Validation
Ensuring hierarchical relationships maintain logical coherence:

- **Inheritance Validation**: Verify child concepts appropriately inherit from parent domains
- **Composition Validation**: Confirm compositional relationships reflect actual structural dependencies
- **Specialization Validation**: Ensure specialized concepts represent valid implementations of general patterns
- **Aggregation Validation**: Verify aggregated elements maintain appropriate independence levels

#### Depth Management Validation
Enforcing hierarchical depth management principles:

- **Three-Plus-One Compliance**: Validate hierarchies respect maximum depth guidelines
- **Cognitive Load Assessment**: Check that hierarchical depth doesn't exceed usability thresholds
- **Breadth-Depth Balance**: Ensure appropriate distribution between hierarchy width and depth
- **Dynamic Depth Appropriateness**: Validate depth matches domain complexity and user expertise

#### Cross-Hierarchical Integrity Validation
Maintaining hierarchical integrity while supporting lateral connections:

- **Bridge Concept Validation**: Verify bridge concepts appropriately connect separate hierarchical structures
- **Cross-Reference Coherence**: Ensure lateral links don't compromise primary hierarchical relationships
- **Contextual Overlay Integrity**: Validate dynamic relationships activate appropriately based on context
- **Mesh Integration Balance**: Confirm hierarchical-network integration points maintain structural coherence

### Advanced Assembly Algorithms

#### Hierarchical-Aware Context Assembly
Enhanced context assembly that leverages hierarchical structuring patterns:

1. **Inheritance Chain Resolution**: Resolve conceptual inheritance relationships following specialized traversal patterns
2. **Compositional Assembly**: Assemble compositional hierarchies respecting structural dependencies
3. **Cross-Hierarchical Integration**: Include lateral connections while preserving primary hierarchical context
4. **Dynamic Depth Adaptation**: Adjust traversal depth based on hierarchical complexity and user needs

#### Pattern-Specific Traversal Rules
Specialized traversal approaches for different hierarchical patterns:

```yaml
# Pattern-specific depth limits and traversal rules  
pattern_traversal_rules:
  inheritance_patterns:
    conceptual_inheritance: 
      max_depth: 5
      traversal_order: "breadth_first"
      include_siblings: true
    behavioral_inheritance:
      max_depth: 3  
      traversal_order: "dependency_first"
      include_overrides: true
      
  composition_patterns:
    aggregative_composition:
      max_depth: 4
      traversal_order: "integral_components_first"  
      include_dependencies: true
    modular_composition:
      max_depth: 3
      traversal_order: "context_driven"
      dynamic_assembly: true
      
  cross_hierarchical_patterns:
    bridge_concepts: 
      max_depth: 2
      traversal_order: "bridge_first"
      maintain_hierarchy: true
    contextual_overlays:
      max_depth: 1
      traversal_order: "context_activated"
      dynamic_inclusion: true
```
