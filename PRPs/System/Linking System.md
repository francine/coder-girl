## Linking Strategies

### Hierarchical Navigation

Use `up` field to define parent-child relationships:

```yaml
up: "[[Authentication Backend.md]]"  # Points to parent context
```

**Purpose**: Establishes clear knowledge hierarchy and inheritance patterns

### Cross-References  

Use `related` field for lateral connections:

```yaml
related: "[[JWT Implementation.md]]"  # Points to related content
```

**Purpose**: Creates knowledge networks without hierarchical dependency

### Dependencies

Use `dependencies` field for required prerequisites:

```yaml
dependencies: "[[Database Schema.md]]"  # Must exist before this
```

**Purpose**: Defines implementation order and required knowledge

### Feature Relationships

Use `feature` field to link tasks to parent features:

```yaml
feature: "[[Auth System Feature.md]]"  # Parent feature context
```

**Purpose**: Groups related tasks under feature umbrellas

## Context Assembly Through Links

### Enhanced Link Resolution Algorithm with Integrated Validation

Integration of knowledge graph navigation strategies with traditional context assembly for intelligent, adaptive context building, enhanced with comprehensive relationship validation to ensure link integrity and semantic consistency:

#### Strategic Navigation-Aware Assembly

**Phase 1: Relationship Validation and Navigation Strategy Selection**
```yaml
relationship_validation_phase:
  pre_assembly_validation:
    - validate_bidirectional_consistency
    - detect_orphaned_relationships
    - verify_semantic_relationship_appropriateness
    - check_cross_reference_integrity
    - scan_for_circular_dependencies
    - validate_relationship_type_compatibility
  
  validation_integration:
    - filter_invalid_relationships
    - flag_validation_warnings
    - apply_automated_relationship_corrections
    - escalate_manual_validation_requirements

assembly_strategy_selection:
  context_analysis:
    - assess_task_complexity
    - determine_user_expertise_level  
    - evaluate_time_constraints
    - identify_implementation_goals
    - apply_relationship_validation_results
  
  strategy_mapping:
    comprehensive_discovery: "breadth_first_exploration"
    deep_expertise_building: "depth_first_investigation"
    balanced_implementation: "hybrid_traversal"
    quick_context_assembly: "weighted_priority_traversal"
```

**Phase 2: Validated Weighted Context Assembly**
```yaml
validated_weighted_context_assembly:
  initialization:
    - parse_target_file_frontmatter
    - extract_all_relationship_types
    - validate_extracted_relationships
    - calculate_relationship_weights
    - apply_contextual_weight_adjustments
    - apply_validation_weight_penalties
    - set_cognitive_load_budget
  
  validated_priority_resolution:
    1. critical_dependencies: weight >= 0.8, depth <= 4, validation_passed
    2. supporting_context: weight 0.6-0.79, depth <= 2, validation_passed
    3. contextual_relevance: dynamic weight, depth <= 3, validation_warnings_acceptable
    4. optional_references: weight < 0.6, depth = 1, validation_warnings_acceptable
    5. feature_context: complete inclusion, validation_passed
    6. target_file: final integration with validation_summary
  
  validation_integration:
    - exclude_relationships_with_critical_validation_failures
    - include_validation_warnings_in_context_notes
    - apply_automated_corrections_to_valid_relationships
    - document_validation_issues_for_manual_review
```

**Phase 3: Navigation Pattern Application**
- **Breadth-First**: When comprehensive understanding needed before specialization
- **Depth-First**: When following critical dependency chains or implementation sequences
- **Hybrid**: When balancing breadth and depth based on relationship weights
- **Weighted Priority**: When cognitive load management is primary concern

#### Traditional Link Resolution Algorithm with Validation (Enhanced Legacy)

Maintained for backward compatibility and simple context assembly scenarios, enhanced with relationship validation:

1. **Parse target file** frontmatter and validate structure
2. **Extract all link types** (up, related, dependencies, feature) and validate relationships
3. **Validate bidirectional consistency** and detect orphaned relationships
4. **Resolve dependencies** to maximum depth 3 with validation checking
5. **Follow up chain** completely to root with relationship validation
6. **Include related content** at depth 1 with semantic validation
7. **Load feature content** completely with cross-reference verification
8. **Apply validation corrections** and flag unresolved issues
9. **Deduplicate** files appearing multiple times
10. **Order by dependency** hierarchy with validation considerations

### Navigation Strategy Integration Examples

#### Strategy-Driven Context Assembly

**Breadth-First Exploration Example:**
```text
Target: 🟡 Task 08 - Document Knowledge Graph Navigation Strategies.md

Navigation Strategy: Breadth-First (comprehensive understanding)
Weight Threshold: 0.6+ (supporting context and above)

Assembly Order:
Level 1 (Immediate Relationships):
├── up: [[Semantic Relationships.md]] (weight: 0.9)
├── feature: [[Semantic Linking Enhancement.md]] (weight: 1.0)
└── related: [[🟡 Task 07 - Create Relationship Weighting Guidelines.md]] (weight: 0.8)

Level 2 (Secondary Relationships):
├── [[Knowledge Organization.md]] (via up chain, weight: 0.8)
├── [[AI Context Engineering.md]] (via dependencies, weight: 0.7)
└── [[Linking System.md]] (via related, weight: 0.6)

Level 3 (Tertiary Context):
└── Additional supporting relationships as budget permits
```

**Depth-First Investigation Example:**
```text
Target: 🔴 Task 01 - Implement JWT Middleware.md

Navigation Strategy: Depth-First (critical dependency chain)
Weight Threshold: 0.8+ (critical dependencies)

Assembly Order:
1. Strongest dependency chain:
   🔴 Task 01 → [[Authentication Backend.md]] (1.0) 
   → [[Security Patterns.md]] (0.9) 
   → [[Cryptographic Standards.md]] (0.8)

2. Secondary critical chain:
   [[Authentication Backend.md]] → [[Database Schema.md]] (0.95)
   → [[User Entity Definition.md]] (0.9)

3. Feature context:
   [[Auth System Feature.md]] (complete inclusion)

4. Target integration with full dependency context
```

**Hybrid Traversal Example:**
```text
Target: 🟠 Task 15 - Optimize API Performance.md

Navigation Strategy: Hybrid (balanced approach)
Weight-Based Strategy Selection:

Critical Dependencies (Depth-First, weight ≥ 0.8):
├── [[Database Optimization.md]] (0.95) → depth 3
├── [[Caching Strategies.md]] (0.9) → depth 2
└── [[Load Balancing.md]] (0.85) → depth 2

Supporting Context (Breadth-First, weight 0.6-0.79):
├── [[Monitoring Patterns.md]] (0.7) → depth 1
├── [[Testing Strategies.md]] (0.65) → depth 1
└── [[Deployment Patterns.md]] (0.6) → depth 1

Optional References (Limited, weight < 0.6):
└── [[Alternative Frameworks.md]] (0.4) → excluded due to budget
```

### Link Chain Examples

#### Simple Chain (Traditional)

```text
🟡 Task 05 - Add User Validation.md
├── up: [[Authentication Backend.md]]
├── feature: [[User Registration Feature.md]]
└── related: [[🟢 Task 03 - Setup Database.md]]
```

**Resolution Order**:

1. `[[User Registration Feature.md]]` (feature)
2. `[[Authentication Backend.md]]` (up chain)
3. `[[🟢 Task 03 - Setup Database.md]]` (related)
4. Target task

#### Complex Chain

```text
🔴 Task 01 - Implement JWT Middleware.md
├── feature: [[Auth System Feature.md]]
│   ├── up: [[Authentication Backend.md]]
│   │   ├── up: [[Backend Architecture.md]]
│   │   └── related: [[Security Patterns.md]]
│   └── dependencies: [[Database Schema.md]]
│       └── up: [[Database Architecture.md]]
└── up: [[Authentication Backend.md]] (deduplicated)
```

**Resolution Order**:

1. `[[Database Schema.md]]` (deepest dependency)
2. `[[Database Architecture.md]]` (dependency up chain)
3. `[[Authentication Backend.md]]` (implementation patterns)
4. `[[Backend Architecture.md]]` (architecture up chain)
5. `[[Security Patterns.md]]` (related patterns)
6. `[[Auth System Feature.md]]` (feature context)
7. Target task

## Error Handling

### Missing Links

**Problem**: Referenced file doesn't exist

```yaml
up: "[[Missing Domain.md]]"  # ERROR: File not found
```

**Actions**:

- Skip link with warning in context
- Create placeholder file if critical
- Continue assembly with available links

### Circular Dependencies

**Problem**: File A links to File B, File B links to File A

```yaml
# File A.md
dependencies: "[[File B.md]]"

# File B.md  
dependencies: "[[File A.md]]"
```

**Actions**:

- Detect cycle during traversal
- Break cycle at detection point
- Include both files once in context
- Log warning about circular dependency

### Depth Limit Exceeded

**Problem**: Link chain exceeds maximum depth

```text
dependencies: A → B → C → D → E (exceeds depth 3)
```

**Actions**:

- Truncate chain at depth limit
- Include warning in assembled context
- Load files within limit only

### Invalid Link Format

**Problem**: Malformed wiki-style links

```yaml
up: "Invalid Link Format"  # Missing [[ ]]
related: [[Missing .md extension]]
```

**Actions**:

- Skip malformed links
- Log formatting error
- Continue with valid links

## Hierarchical Relationship Patterns

### Hierarchical Link Types

Enhanced link types that support sophisticated hierarchical structuring patterns:

#### Inheritance Relationships
- **`inherits`**: Child concepts inherit properties from parent domains
- **`specializes`**: Child represents specific implementation of parent concept  
- **`overrides`**: Child provides specialized behavior that replaces inherited patterns
- **`extends`**: Child adds capabilities while preserving parent functionality

#### Composition Relationships  
- **`composed-of`**: Parent contains child as integral component
- **`aggregates`**: Parent coordinates multiple independent children
- **`layers-on`**: Child builds on parent as foundational layer
- **`modules-into`**: Child can be recombined in different parent contexts

#### Cross-Hierarchical Relationships
- **`bridges-to`**: Creates connection between separate hierarchical trees
- **`cross-references`**: Lateral connection preserving primary hierarchy
- **`contextually-relates`**: Dynamic relationship activated by specific contexts
- **`mesh-integrates`**: Intersection point between hierarchical and network patterns

### Hierarchical Traversal Patterns

#### Inheritance Chain Traversal
Systematic navigation of conceptual inheritance relationships:

```yaml
# Inheritance traversal depth limits
inheritance_traversal:
  conceptual_inheritance: 5 levels  # Follow conceptual chains deeply
  behavioral_inheritance: 3 levels  # Implementation patterns moderate depth
  contextual_inheritance: 2 levels  # Environmental factors shallow depth
  selective_inheritance: 1 level    # Explicit overrides immediate only
```

#### Composition Hierarchy Navigation
Optimized paths through compositional structures:

- **Aggregative Composition**: Traverse all integral components at current level before descending
- **Associative Composition**: Follow independent component chains in dependency order  
- **Layered Composition**: Traverse layers in architectural order (foundation to application)
- **Modular Composition**: Dynamic traversal based on current assembly context

#### Cross-Hierarchical Path Finding
Navigation patterns that maintain hierarchical integrity while enabling lateral connections:

- **Bridge Traversal**: Follow bridge concepts to connect separate hierarchical trees
- **Network Overlay**: Navigate lateral connections without breaking primary hierarchical paths
- **Contextual Activation**: Dynamically include cross-hierarchical relationships based on implementation goals
- **Mesh Integration**: Balance hierarchical and network navigation at integration points

### Hierarchical Validation Rules

#### Relationship Consistency Validation
Ensuring hierarchical relationships maintain logical coherence:

- **Inheritance Validation**: Verify child concepts appropriately inherit from parent domains
- **Composition Validation**: Confirm compositional relationships reflect actual structural dependencies
- **Specialization Validation**: Ensure specialized concepts represent valid implementations of general patterns
- **Aggregation Validation**: Verify aggregated elements maintain appropriate independence levels

#### Depth Management Validation
Enforcing hierarchical depth management principles:

- **Three-Plus-One Compliance**: Validate hierarchies respect maximum depth guidelines
- **Cognitive Load Assessment**: Check that hierarchical depth doesn't exceed usability thresholds
- **Breadth-Depth Balance**: Ensure appropriate distribution between hierarchy width and depth
- **Dynamic Depth Appropriateness**: Validate depth matches domain complexity and user expertise

#### Cross-Hierarchical Integrity Validation
Maintaining hierarchical integrity while supporting lateral connections:

- **Bridge Concept Validation**: Verify bridge concepts appropriately connect separate hierarchical structures
- **Cross-Reference Coherence**: Ensure lateral links don't compromise primary hierarchical relationships
- **Contextual Overlay Integrity**: Validate dynamic relationships activate appropriately based on context
- **Mesh Integration Balance**: Confirm hierarchical-network integration points maintain structural coherence

### Advanced Assembly Algorithms

#### Hierarchical-Aware Context Assembly
Enhanced context assembly that leverages hierarchical structuring patterns:

1. **Inheritance Chain Resolution**: Resolve conceptual inheritance relationships following specialized traversal patterns
2. **Compositional Assembly**: Assemble compositional hierarchies respecting structural dependencies
3. **Cross-Hierarchical Integration**: Include lateral connections while preserving primary hierarchical context
4. **Dynamic Depth Adaptation**: Adjust traversal depth based on hierarchical complexity and user needs

#### Pattern-Specific Traversal Rules
Specialized traversal approaches for different hierarchical patterns:

```yaml
# Pattern-specific depth limits and traversal rules  
pattern_traversal_rules:
  inheritance_patterns:
    conceptual_inheritance: 
      max_depth: 5
      traversal_order: "breadth_first"
      include_siblings: true
    behavioral_inheritance:
      max_depth: 3  
      traversal_order: "dependency_first"
      include_overrides: true

    bridge_concepts: 
      max_depth: 2
      traversal_order: "bridge_first"
      maintain_hierarchy: true
    contextual_overlays:
      max_depth: 1
