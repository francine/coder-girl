## Context Engineering Framework

<<<<<<< HEAD
The PRP system implements a Context Engineering pipeline that transforms specifications into distributed documentation and reassembles context dynamically for implementation. This framework incorporates modern knowledge organization principles to optimize both human cognition and AI processing effectiveness.

### Modern Knowledge Organization Integration

The methodology integrates contemporary knowledge organization theories to enhance systematic information structuring:

#### Semantic Network Principles
- **Concept Node Design**: Each PRP file serves as a semantic node with clear conceptual boundaries and typed relationships
- **Relationship Edge Optimization**: Frontmatter links preserve semantic meaning and enable efficient context traversal
- **Network Topology Management**: File structures optimized for graph traversal while maintaining human navigability
- **Semantic Density Balance**: Information distribution prevents cognitive overload while ensuring comprehensive coverage

#### Ontological Framework Application
- **Domain Modeling**: Systematic representation of knowledge areas using formal hierarchical structures
- **Property Inheritance**: Child concepts automatically inherit patterns and relationships from parent domains
- **Aximatic Constraints**: Logical rules governing valid file relationships and dependency structures
- **Conceptual Hierarchy Validation**: Automated checking that knowledge structures maintain logical consistency

#### Cognitive Load Optimization
- **Progressive Context Assembly**: Information presented in manageable chunks following dependency hierarchies
- **Intrinsic Load Management**: Complex domains decomposed into atomic units matching cognitive processing capacity
- **Extraneous Load Elimination**: Organizational structures minimize unnecessary cognitive overhead
'- **Germane Load Enhancement**: File organization facilitates pattern recognition and knowledge schema development
'''
### DTF Framework

- **Domains**: Reusable knowledge and context patterns organized as atomic knowledge units
- **Tasks**: Specific action items with severity tracking and semantic relationship preservation
- **Features**: Development efforts grouping related tasks with hierarchical inheritance patterns

## generate-prp Command

### Input Processing

**Input**: `PRPs/PROMPT.md` specification file
**Output**: Network of linked atomic documents

### Processing Algorithm

1. **Parse** PROMPT.md for distinct features and requirements
2. **Create** one feature file per distinct functionality using `Templates/feature-template.md`
3. **Create** task files for implementation steps using severity emojis
4. **Create** domain files for reusable patterns and knowledge
5. **Link** all files via frontmatter relationships

### Feature Detection Pattern

- Each noun phrase describing functionality = potential feature
- Each verb phrase describing action = potential task
- Each knowledge area mentioned = potential domain

### Domain Decomposition Integration

Complex knowledge areas identified during feature detection should be systematically decomposed using appropriate strategies from [[Knowledge Organization.md]]:

#### Decomposition Strategy Selection

**Assessment Criteria:**
1. **Organizational Driver**: What is the primary organizing principle? (capabilities, architecture, users, processes)
2. **Complexity Level**: How complex is the knowledge area? (high complexity â†’ deeper decomposition required)
3. **Team Structure**: How are development teams organized? (align decomposition with team responsibilities)
4. **Evolution Patterns**: How will this domain change over time? (choose sustainable decomposition approaches)

**Strategy Application:**
- **Functional Decomposition**: Use when PROMPT.md describes distinct capabilities or service areas
- **Technical Decomposition**: Apply when technical architecture or implementation layers are primary concerns
- **User-Centric Decomposition**: Select when user workflows and experience optimization drive organization
- **Process Decomposition**: Choose when business processes or operational workflows are central organizing elements

#### Decomposition Implementation Process

1. **Initial Domain Identification**: Extract high-level knowledge areas from PROMPT.md specification
2. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate each domain for internal complexity and subdivision opportunities
3. **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate decomposition strategy based on assessment criteria
4. **Subdomain Creation**: Break complex domains into atomic knowledge units following selected strategy
5. **Relationship Mapping**: Establish proper frontmatter links between parent domains and subdomains
6. **Validation**: Ensure decomposed structure maintains logical coherence and supports context assembly

#### Decomposition Quality Checkpoints

- **Atomic Responsibility**: Each subdomain addresses exactly one coherent knowledge area
- **Clear Boundaries**: Domain boundaries are well-defined with minimal overlap
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships reflect actual conceptual or implementation dependencies
- **Context Completeness**: Each domain contains sufficient context for standalone comprehension
- **Assembly Efficiency**: Decomposed structure supports efficient context assembly for task execution

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All features from PROMPT.md have corresponding feature files
- [ ] All tasks have proper severity classification and numbering
- [ ] All domains contain reusable knowledge patterns
- [ ] All frontmatter links resolve to existing files
- [ ] Dependency graph is acyclic and complete

### Relationship Weighting Integration

The context assembly process leverages relationship weighting from [[Semantic Relationships.md]] to enable intelligent context prioritization and cognitive load management:

#### Weight-Based Link Selection

**Pre-Assembly Filtering**:
- **Context Assessment**: Analyze current task requirements to determine contextual relevance multipliers
- **User Profile Application**: Apply user expertise level adjustments to base relationship weights  
- **Phase-Specific Adjustment**: Modify weights based on implementation phase (planning, development, testing, maintenance)
- **Threshold Calculation**: Calculate dynamic filtering thresholds based on cognitive load budget and task complexity

**Filtering Strategy Application**:
- **Depth 1 Links**: Include relationships â‰¥ 0.6 adjusted weight (supporting context and above)
- **Depth 2 Links**: Include relationships â‰¥ 0.7 adjusted weight (strong supporting context and critical dependencies)
- **Depth 3 Links**: Include only relationships â‰¥ 0.8 adjusted weight (critical dependencies only)
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust filtering thresholds based on available cognitive budget and context complexity

#### Weighted Context Prioritization

**Assembly Order Enhancement**:
1. **Critical Dependencies** (Weight â‰¥ 0.8): Load first to establish foundational knowledge
2. **Strong Supporting Context** (Weight 0.7-0.79): Load second to provide implementation guidance and patterns
3. **Contextual Relevance** (Dynamic Weight): Load based on current task relevance calculation
4. **Optional References** (Weight < 0.6): Load last and only if cognitive budget allows

**Cognitive Load Management**:
- **Information Budget Allocation**: Distribute context loading across Primary (60%), Extended (30%), and Enrichment (10%) budgets
- **Weight-Based Truncation**: Remove lowest-weight relationships first when context limits are exceeded
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present critical relationships immediately with on-demand access to supporting context

#### Dynamic Weight Calculation

**Context-Sensitive Adjustment Formula**:
```
Final Weight = Base Weight Ã— Context Multiplier Ã— User Multiplier Ã— Phase Multiplier
```

**Real-Time Weight Factors**:
- **Task Relevance**: 1.0-1.5 multiplier for relationships directly addressing current implementation goals
- **Expertise Adjustment**: 0.7-1.4 multiplier based on user knowledge level and domain familiarity
- **Implementation Phase**: 1.2-1.5 multiplier for relationships critical to current development phase
- **Cognitive Load State**: 0.8-1.2 multiplier based on current information processing capacity

#### Integration with AI Context Engineering

- **Focused Pattern Recognition**: Emphasize high-weight relationships in pattern templates and analogical frameworks
- **Selective Noise Reduction**: Apply weight-based filtering to remove low-relevance information while preserving critical context

**Enhanced Assembly Effectiveness**:
- **Relevance Maximization**: Weight-based selection ensures assembled context directly supports task completion
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: Relationship weights prevent information overload while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- **Adaptive Context**: Dynamic weighting enables context assembly that adjusts to changing task requirements and user needs
- **Quality Optimization**: High-weight relationships receive priority in conflict resolution and duplicate context scenarios

#### Context Filtering Strategies Integration

The context assembly process now incorporates comprehensive context filtering strategies from [[AI Context Engineering.md]] to optimize cognitive load management and preserve essential information through intelligent filtering:

**Need-Based Assembly Integration**:
```yaml
need_based_filtering_in_assembly:
  goal_analysis_phase:
    - extract_task_objectives: parse task acceptance criteria and implementation requirements
    - map_implementation_success_criteria: identify essential knowledge for task completion
    - assess_context_complexity: evaluate information requirements vs cognitive capacity
    - define_relevance_boundaries: establish clear inclusion/exclusion criteria
  
  context_selection_phase:
    - apply_direct_relevance_filter: include only context essential for goal achievement
    - evaluate_supporting_relevance: include context that enhances implementation quality  
    - assess_contextual_relevance: include background preventing critical errors
    - exclude_tangential_context: remove information not supporting current objectives
  
  adaptive_refinement_phase:
    - apply_phase_based_adjustments: modify context based on development phase
    - implement_expertise_calibration: adjust context depth for user knowledge level
    - factor_constraint_considerations: account for technical and business limitations
    - integrate_feedback_learning: refine filtering based on implementation outcomes
```

**Progressive Disclosure Implementation**:

- **Advanced Integration Layer**: Include complex patterns and edge cases (30% cognitive load) only when needed for comprehensive coverage
- **Understanding-Based Progression**: Use task progress and AI feedback to trigger appropriate disclosure layers

**Relevance Scoring Integration**:
```yaml
scoring_based_assembly:
  multi_dimensional_evaluation:
    task_relevance_scoring: 0.4 weight for goal alignment and implementation necessity
    relationship_strength_scoring: 0.3 weight for semantic connection strength and dependency criticality
    processing_efficiency_scoring: 0.2 weight for AI comprehension speed and context window optimization
    temporal_relevance_scoring: 0.1 weight for content recency and maintenance activity
  
  assembly_threshold_application:
    critical_inclusion: score >= 0.8 (always include in context assembly)
    supporting_inclusion: score >= 0.6 (include when cognitive budget permits)
    optional_inclusion: score >= 0.4 (include only for comprehensive understanding goals)
    exclusion_threshold: score < 0.3 (exclude to preserve cognitive resources)
```

**Adaptive Filtering Implementation**:
