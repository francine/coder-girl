## Overview

This guide provides practical application scenarios and implementation patterns for knowledge graph navigation strategies within the PRP system. It demonstrates how to apply systematic traversal patterns, weighted navigation, and context discovery mechanisms to achieve specific knowledge exploration and context assembly goals.

## Navigation Strategy Selection Framework

### Decision Matrix for Strategy Selection

Choose the optimal navigation strategy based on your current goals and constraints:

```yaml
strategy_selection_matrix:
  comprehensive_understanding:
    strategy: "breadth_first_exploration"
    use_when: "Need to understand all related concepts before specializing"
    cognitive_load: "moderate"
    time_investment: "high"
    
  deep_expertise_building:
    strategy: "depth_first_investigation"  
    use_when: "Need thorough understanding of specific knowledge chain"
    cognitive_load: "high"
    time_investment: "moderate"
    
  balanced_implementation:
    strategy: "hybrid_traversal"
    use_when: "Need both breadth and depth with intelligent prioritization"
    cognitive_load: "moderate"
    time_investment: "moderate"
    
  quick_context_assembly:
    strategy: "weighted_priority_traversal"
    use_when: "Time-constrained implementation with cognitive load management"
    cognitive_load: "low"
    time_investment: "low"
```

### Context Assessment Checklist

Before selecting a navigation strategy, assess your current context:

**Task Complexity Assessment:**
- [ ] **Simple Task**: Single concept with few dependencies â†’ Use traditional linking
- [ ] **Moderate Task**: Multiple related concepts with clear relationships â†’ Use weighted priority traversal
- [ ] **Complex Task**: Many interdependent concepts requiring comprehensive understanding â†’ Use breadth-first exploration
- [ ] **Expert Task**: Deep domain knowledge required with critical dependency chains â†’ Use depth-first investigation

**User Expertise Level:**
- [ ] **Novice**: Need comprehensive supporting context â†’ Increase weight thresholds, use breadth-first
- [ ] **Intermediate**: Standard weighting and balanced approach â†’ Use hybrid traversal
- [ ] **Expert**: Focus on critical dependencies only â†’ Use depth-first with high weight thresholds

**Time and Cognitive Constraints:**
- [ ] **High Time Pressure**: Use weighted priority traversal with strict budget limits
- [ ] **Moderate Time**: Use hybrid traversal with adaptive depth
- [ ] **Learning Focus**: Use breadth-first exploration for comprehensive understanding
- [ ] **Implementation Focus**: Use depth-first investigation for critical dependencies

    strategy: "depth_first_investigation"
    weight: 0.7
  
  secondary_goal:
    objective: "understand_alternatives"
    strategy: "breadth_first_exploration"  
    weight: 0.3
